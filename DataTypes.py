# JAVA
# Primitive data types in Java are byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char.
# Non-Primitive is java is String.

# PYTHON
# has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:
# You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function
# However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.
"""
Text Type       :	str
Numeric Types   :	int, float, complex
Sequence Types  :	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type    :	dict
Set Types       :	set, frozenset
Boolean Type    :	bool
Binary Types    :	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type       :	NoneType

# Setting the Data Type
# In Python, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable:
"""
x = "Hello World"	=str type	
x = 20	            =int type	
x = 20.5	        =float type	
x = 1j	            =complex type

x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")	=tuple type
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}	=set type
x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"}) =frozenset type
x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}	=dict type
x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]	=list type

x = range(6)	    =range type

x = True / False	=bool type	
x = b"Hello"	    =bytes type	
x = bytearray(5)	=bytearray type	
x = memoryview(bytes(5))	=memoryview	 type
x = None	        =None type
